## I added some extra features to the existing project which was created by Akhror Web (https://github.com/AkhrorSoliev)
- I used Binary Search Algorithm to efficiently find the index of the clicked element from the List of Todos, and by doing this I enhanced the process of editing and deleting a list
- Before deleting process, it shows you a modal to ask you "Are you sure to delete?"
- I added "Clear All" button to clear everything, included: input, local storage and todo list
- Since the text content for list is limited, I added new "read the whole text" function
